                    <p>In 2466, I inherited wealth and aimed to become the Flash. I bought the Cosmic Treadmill, hoping for super speed, but it scarred me instead. I used my wealth to look like Barry Allen. My time travel attempt with the treadmill went awry, placing me after Barry's death. Discovering posters labeling me "Eobard Thawne" and my evil deeds drove me insane, turning me into a psychotic villain.
